## Bulma Framework Examples

Compilation of the small Bulma CSS framework templates/themes I've made. These aren't perfect--not by any means.

Can download all, any or one and change as much as you like.

_Update: 21/01/2018_

So, I love Bulma to pieces. But, I don't have the time I would like to have to continue to play around with it. Meaning, this repository isn't dead, but I may not update it anywhere near as frequently as I may have during the latter half of 2016 and the early parts of 2017.

### Example Links

Below are examples of the templates in this repository. Most, with very few exceptions, examples have the following pages: index page, about page, static page (blog post, for example) and contact page.

### Notes

I've added a "clean" branch for markup cleanups. A lot of these templates have uncessary HTML tags, aside from one or two.

If you're finding that your footers are not tied to the very bottom of the page, take a look at [Philip Walton's Sticky Footer](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/).

A lot of these templates are not up to date with the current Bulma framework version.
